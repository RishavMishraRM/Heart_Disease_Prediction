# Heart_Disease_Prediction
Heart Disease Prediction using SVM

A disease is an unnatural medical condition that negatively affects the functional state of an organism and is generally associated with certain signs of illness. As reported by World Health Organization (WHO), Heart Disease and Stroke are the world’s biggest killers and have remained the leading causes of death globally in the last 15 years.<br />

In the direction of predicting heart disease, Machine Learning can present remarkable features that simplify the identification of unseen patterns, eventually providing clinical insights that assist physicians in planning and providing care.<br />

In this analysis, the presence of heart disease is predicted by employing Support VectorMachine (SVM), Multinomial Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT) & Random Forest (RF), Ensemble combination rules i.e., Majority Voting & Weighted Average Voting and Ensemble classifiers i.e., Bagging, Adaptive Boosting & Gradient Boosting.Parameters such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1-score were estimated to analyze the performance and a comparative study of these classifiers was carried out.

## Python Libraries
Python libraries are a collection of functions and methods that allows us to perform many actions without writing the code.<br>
**NumPy**: NumPy is a very popular python library for large multi-dimensional array and matrix processing, with the help of a large collection of high-level mathematical functions. It is very useful for fundamental scientific computations in Machine Learning.<br /><br />
**Pandas**: Pandas is a popular Python library for data analysis. Pandas is developed specifically for data extraction and preparation.<br /><br />
**Matplotlib**: Matpoltlib is a very popular Python library for data visualization. It provides various kinds of graphs and plots for data visualization, viz., histogram, error charts, bar chats, etc.<br /><br />
**Scikit-learn**: Scikit-learn is one of the most popular ML libraries for classical ML algorithms. Scikit-learn supports most of the supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms. Scikit-learncan also be used for data-mining and data-analysis, which makes it a great tool who is starting out with ML.<br /><br />
**Seaborn**: Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.<br /><br />
**train_test_split**: It splits the dataset into a training set and a test set.<br />
