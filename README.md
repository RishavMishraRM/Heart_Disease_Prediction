Heart Disease Prediction using SVM

A disease is an unnatural medical condition that negatively affects the functional state of an organism and is generally associated with certain signs of illness. As reported by World Health Organization (WHO), Heart Disease and Stroke are the worldâ€™s biggest killers and have remained the leading causes of death globally in the last 15 years.<br />

In the direction of predicting heart disease, Machine Learning can present remarkable features that simplify the identification of unseen patterns, eventually providing clinical insights that assist physicians in planning and providing care.<br />
