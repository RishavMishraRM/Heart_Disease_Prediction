Heart Disease Prediction using SVM

A disease is an unnatural medical condition that negatively affects the functional state of an organism and is generally associated with certain signs of illness. As reported by World Health Organization (WHO), Heart Disease and Stroke are the world’s biggest killers and have remained the leading causes of death globally in the last 15 years.<br />

In the direction of predicting heart disease, Machine Learning can present remarkable features that simplify the identification of unseen patterns, eventually providing clinical insights that assist physicians in planning and providing care.<br />

In this analysis, the presence of heart disease is predicted by employing Support VectorMachine (SVM), Multinomial Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT) & Random Forest (RF), Ensemble combination rules i.e., Majority Voting & Weighted Average Voting and Ensemble classifiers i.e., Bagging, Adaptive Boosting & Gradient Boosting.Parameters such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1-score were estimated to analyze the performance and a comparative study of these classifiers was carried out.

## Python Libraries
Python libraries are a collection of functions and methods that allows us to perform many actions without writing the code.
